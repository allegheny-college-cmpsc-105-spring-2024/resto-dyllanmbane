Jimmy Tims: 

I would rate my experience at Cafe Coku a 9.5/10. It was really good but I did have some issues with the take on fish and chips. This was the first meal I had here with also some eggs benedict which made the overall experience a lot more better. The prices here are insane for what! I ended up paying up to two hundred dollars for two dishes and some drinks, which felt a little outrageous to me. After eating the food I did kind of understand since it was really good and the portions were also pretty big. Another thing I also enjoyed were the customers and workers present at the cafe. I ran into Zendaya who is an old friend of mine and we chatted for a while. The cafe really prioritizes helping people who are just better than others and I was one of those people. It was really refreshing and something that I don't get to experience in places that allow just anyone to come into their stores. Being such a high class person the Cafe Coku was a perfect place for me to enjoy a meal and interact with other amazing people.
