Jimmy Tims: 

I would rate my experience at Restaurant of Regions a 7.5/10. It was not terrible but I did not fully enjoy their take on some European cuisine. My meal of choice was the Beans and Bread Sandwich with mashed potatoes, it was not awful but it was not one of the best beans and toast I have ever had. I had a green tea with two shots of pisco with my meal, it paired nicely and I would definitely get the pisco again. I also decided to take a fusion dish home, it was very good. The Cajun Green Bean Casserole was very spicy but was worth the overall taste. It contained seasoned green beans with a chicken broth base and the use of cajun sauce which really put it all together. The casserole made the experience a lot better and I would recommend those going here to try one of their fusion dishes.
