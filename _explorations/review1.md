Shelly Duvual: 

Energy Drink Emporium is a great place to go and enjoy an energy drink before an activity. I recently went before my 10 mile jog with my menâ€™s choir club and it was truly divine. I had their brick of caffeine which was to die for and would definitely get again. It did keep me up for a couple days, but that was the goal and I was able to enjoy a nice caffeine brick and finish two weeks of school work. The price was not bad either since 20 dollars for a brick that had me jumping for two days was totally worth it. After leaving I grab a bunch of One Dollar Energy Drinks that were only a dollar. They were really good but made my heart race at an abnormal speed, but it was worth it. Overall I would definitely go again especially if I wanna stay up for days on end. I encourage everyone to try the brick at least once if you plan on visiting.
